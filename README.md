# Cryptopals Challenges

This repository contains my Python solutions to the
[Matasano Crypto Challenges](http://cryptopals.com/).

Where possible I have tried to keep this code functional in both Python 2 and
Python 3. The goal is to keep this code as close to production-ready as
possible: it should be an example of good coding style for Python.
